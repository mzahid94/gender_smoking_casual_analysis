# Causal Effects Of Gender On Smoking Behavior
This study investigates the causal effects of gender on smoking behavior, while accounting for
marital status as a potential confounding variable. Our analysis is underpinned by a DAG that
models the relationships between our primary outcome, smoking behavior (S), and the key variables
of gender (G), marital status (M), and age (A). The DAG illustrates the hypothesized pathways
through which gender may directly influence smoking and how this effect could be modified by
marital status and age. Employing Bayesian statistical methods, we aim to quantify the direct
and total causal effects of gender on smoking, providing clearer insights into how these variables
interact. The outcomes of this study are expected to refine our understanding of the determinants
of smoking and aid in the development of targeted public health strategies.
